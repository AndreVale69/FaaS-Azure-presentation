# FaaS - Azure Presentation

I created this little project for a computer science course.\
\
The goal were explore Azure technology. I created a "flow" (on Azure platform) where you received a text message on you phone whenever a user uploaded a file to the Cloud.\
So, the code I made should be imported on Azure Cloud Functions.\
\
The presentation made with LaTeX using Beamer ([package link][1]).\
\
The whole project is in Italian because the course was.
